# Using Python programming to Drive a RC Car


Explorations of Using Python to drive a RC Car, mainly for the purposes of creating self-driving cars and other vehicles.

We read frames being streamed to the Desktop via the RaspberryPi Camera. The program will then basically learn (well, attempt to learn...) whatever you put in front of it based on the frames as input and key presses as output.

Pull requests are welcomed.
